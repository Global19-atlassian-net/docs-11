======================
Histogram Equalization
======================

This examples takes an image with low contrast and enhances its contrast using
histogram equalization. Histogram equalization enhances contrast by "spreading
out the most frequent intensity values" in an image [1]_. The equalized image
has a roughly linear cumulative distribution function, as shown in this example.
